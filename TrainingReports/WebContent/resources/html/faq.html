                                    for a specific Colleague.  In addition to Colleague names, each Colleague is listed 
                                    by their District, Role (eg, TSR, PHR), Emplid (eg, Pfizer Employee ID), and Team 
                                    (eg, Parke-Davis)

                                    The primary benefit is that depending on your level (eg, SVP, VP, RM, or DM), you will

                                    to determine the number of Colleagues who completed FFT Product Training, as 
                                    well as the number <br>

                                    training.  Another benefit is <br>
                                    that the Report 
                                    Tool provides detailed information so that

                                    specific developmental steps are required 
                                    (eg, Transitional Training, Coaching, etc).  The Report <br>
